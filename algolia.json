When BOOST is triggered, the minimal collecting interval can reach 20 seconds (the interval varies on different devices). The conditions that can trigger BOOST are listed below:\n Voltage\nWhen the battery voltage is higher than the predefined threshold, BOOST is triggered automatically. When the battery voltage drops back to the threshold, BOOST stops.  Speed\nWhen the instant speed of the device and the battery voltage are higher than the predefined threshold, BOOST is triggered automatically. When the instant speed or the battery voltage drops back to the threshold, BOOST stops.  BOOST is designed to portray detailed movement track in a more \u0026amp;ldquo;intelligent\u0026amp;rdquo; way instead of manual intervention. Traditionally, the user has to monitor the device power status constantly so as to modify settings if they want more data without battery drain, while BOOST just automatically regulates the intervals if the charging condition is good and the animal deployed with the device is active.\nWhen BOOST is triggered, you can get much more GPS fixes than usual. More GPS fixes can bring more detailed reflection on the animal behaviour. With other collected data, you can get a more accurate profile for your study object. The illustration below shows the movement track of a bird in 30 minutes. This bird was deployed with DEBUT LEGO. When BOOST is on, LEGO collects more than 100 GPS fixes in 30 minutes. Note that the collecting interval is changed dynamically during the BOOST period.\n","date":1508253975,"description":"","lastmod":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","objectID":"b0cb7e4942641f896559047de11467d8","permalink":"https://druid-tech.github.io/help/faq/boost/","publishdate":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","title":"What is BOOST?"},{"content":"Before you start, you must export the GPS data in CSV format.
