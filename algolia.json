When BOOST is triggered, the minimal collecting interval can reach 20 seconds (the interval varies on different devices). The conditions that can trigger BOOST are listed below:\n Voltage\nWhen the battery voltage is higher than the predefined threshold, BOOST is triggered automatically. When the battery voltage drops back to the threshold, BOOST stops.  Speed\nWhen the instant speed of the device and the battery voltage are higher than the predefined threshold, BOOST is triggered automatically. When the instant speed or the battery voltage drops back to the threshold, BOOST stops.  BOOST is designed to portray detailed movement track in a more \u0026amp;ldquo;intelligent\u0026amp;rdquo; way instead of manual intervention. Traditionally, the user has to monitor the device power status constantly so as to modify settings if they want more data without battery drain, while BOOST just automatically regulates the intervals if the charging condition is good and the animal deployed with the device is active.\nWhen BOOST is triggered, you can get much more GPS fixes than usual. More GPS fixes can bring more detailed reflection on the animal behaviour. With other collected data, you can get a more accurate profile for your study object. The illustration below shows the movement track of a bird in 30 minutes. This bird was deployed with DEBUT LEGO. When BOOST is on, LEGO collects more than 100 GPS fixes in 30 minutes. Note that the collecting interval is changed dynamically during the BOOST period.\n","date":1508253975,"description":"","lastmod":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","objectID":"b0cb7e4942641f896559047de11467d8","permalink":"https://druid-tech.github.io/help/faq/boost/","publishdate":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","title":"What is BOOST?"},{"content":"A terminal device collects data by itself while a gateway device collects data from other terminal devices and then transmits the data to the next object (which could be the base station, satellite, or mobile phone).\nThe devices deployed to animals are mostly terminal devices, while Debut HUB functions both as a terminal device and a gateway device.\n","date":1508253975,"description":"","lastmod":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","objectID":"98a22af2a35f34a551857da0594a8d0d","permalink":"https://druid-tech.github.io/help/faq/gateway_terminal/","publishdate":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","title":"What are terminal devices and gateway devices?"},{"content":"When BOOST is triggered, it automatically regulates the GPS and other data collecting intervals, so as to utilize the energy better and contribute more to the movement research.\nWith the BOOST feature, the device intelligently enhance data frequency on the basis of energy balance without manual interference.
